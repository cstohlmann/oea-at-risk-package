## Use Case Documentation

The [OEA Chronic Absenteeism Package - Use Case Documentation](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-at-risk-package/blob/d52b29fa918a95c6cb084e70f54a9a6aa2cdf00e/Chronic_Absenteeism/docs/OEA%20Chronic%20Abs%20Package%20-%20Use%20Case%20Doc.pdf) provides guidance on the end-to-end process of developing a successful Chronic Absenteeism use case project. This document includes 
 - defining of the use case problem,
 - key stakeholder identification and engagement in the project,
 - mapping research theory to data,
 - and implementing principles of responsible data and AI in the process of predictive modelling. 
The use case document was completed in collaboration with through a partnership between Microsoft Education, [Kwantum Analytics](https://www.kwantumanalytics.com/), and [Fresno Unified School District](https://www.fresnounified.org/) in Fresno, California.

## Package Asset Use Instructions

The Chronic Absenteeism Package provides multiple assets to help accellerate the implementation of chronic absence predictive models in education.

1. <strong>Use Case Documentation</strong> 
      * Engaging key stakeholders at the beginning of any data-driven project is essential. The use case document should be completed at the beginning of all projects to clearly define the problem, identify key stakeholders, connect data to research, and address any ethical concerns. Further, completing this document helps to carefully define the problem and approach.
2. <strong>[Notebooks](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-at-risk-package/blob/e5bb16c5e7d920c79d99a4112943e92081792817/Chronic_Absenteeism/notebooks/readme.md)</strong> 
      * Package notebooks provide example code for standardizing and processing data to make ready for machine learning and PowerBI dashboards. Notebooks were developed to fit the [OEA framework](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/07aa28a00b36a1822b69a11b1ac04f0748d1b675/framework/notebook/OEA_py.ipynb) and can be edited and adapted to suit any envirnment. 
3. <strong>[Pipelines](https://github.com/cstohlmann/oea-at-risk-package/blob/04bc44c2e09e07bc617f91eb403c372ae3aab70d/Chronic_Absenteeism/pipelines/readme.md)</strong> 
      * <em>What needs to be done:</em> If you prefer to hand-build a model, you can go into the pipeline and rather than kicking off the data to AutoML, build your own notebook for model training and development. You can view model training progress and iterations in the <strong><em>(AutoML Studio??)</strong></em>
      * <strong><em>[INCLUDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS CHAD SEES FIT]</strong></em>
4. <strong>PowerBI Updates:</strong> If the table names, column names or schemas are changed from any original names to new names; these will need to be reflected in the Power BI dashboard template.
      * <em>What needs to be done:</em> If the above is applicable to you, make the necessary updates to the dashboard to mirror the schema changes. Also, ensure that you've made adjustments to graphs and visualizations to reflect solution(s) to your personal problem statement(s).
