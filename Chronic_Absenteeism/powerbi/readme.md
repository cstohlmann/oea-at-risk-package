# Power BI Example

The OEA Chronic Absenteeism Package includes example Power BI dashboards which were developed in collaboration with key stakeholders at [Fresno Unified School District](https://www.fresnounified.org/) in Fresno, California. The aim of these dashboards is to:
  - give a district [overview of chronic absence status](#overview-of-chronic-absence),
  - identify the top [drivers (reasons) for chronic absence](#drivers_of_chronic_absence) as explained by the Machine Learning Model,
  - help design school and student interventions which are most impactful,
  - and provide a view for social workers to monitor chronic absense.
